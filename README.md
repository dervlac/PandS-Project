Repository for Fisher's Iris Project for Programming and Scripting Module

## Introduction
Fisher's Iris data is so-called due to the 1936 paper by the statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher, and his paper titled *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*. The data was initially collected by Edgar Anderson in the year prior.

## Data
The data set consists of measurements relating to 3 classes of iris; iris setosa, iris versicolor, and iris virginica. For a sample of 50 flowers from each species, measurements were taken of sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Thus the data set consists of 150 rows, with 5 attributes per row.

## Accuracy
Following the download of the dataset from the source cited below, upon further research I noted that there have been variations in the data set referenced throughout the years. As noted at the data source, these variations relate to samples 35 and 38 of the data set I selected. Following comparison with the data set noted as most probable in the article *Will the real iris data please stand up?* by Bezdek, Keller et al, I have subequently updated the values for samples 35 and 38 to most accurately reflect the original data used by Fisher in his 1936 analysis.
